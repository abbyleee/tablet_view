            <p>Cooper is an 8yr old border collie and lab mix. We rescued him from the Humane Society as a puppy! He loves going on long walks/runs, but he stops to sniff something every few steps. He’s pretty friendly, but he loves to loudly bark at delivery people who ring the doorbell.</p> 
            <br>
            <p>Whenever it’s movie night, Cooper has to join on the couch/bed or he feels left out. He loves to cuddle and pats on his tummy. Cooper will play fetch for about 2 or 3 rounds, but he quickly gets bored. He leaves his toys all around the house for the rest of the family to find.</p>

            <p>Mocha is a 5-year-old quarter Maltese, quarter Yorkshire Terrier, and half mutt. He was not adopted but actually born into the family and lives with his mommy Mochi and a loving family. Mocha likes to fool people into thinking that he's a dummy boy then making an intelligent comeback to surprise everyone of his big brain. He recently got a new toy that squeaks so high that he gets so excited everytime he chews on it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If Mocha likes something or someone, he likes to rub his neck on it. This includes (but not limited to) rubber toys, favorite snacks, blankets, and human faces. As soon as someone lays down facing up, Mocha will run out from somewhere in the house and launch himself onto your face. It seems to be his favorite activity.</p>

            <p>Jingle is a domestic shorthair cat with a white chest and belly and a striped black and gray back. His paws are white and they look like mittens.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Jingle loves going outside. He used to be an outdoor/indoor cat until we realized that he loved to get injured. Now, we take him on walks with a leash which he loves! Every time he sees me carrying the leash he goes crazy and meows to go out. Jingle is very mischievous, he has gotten into many different accidents. His first accident was outside; a bee stung his paw and he cried all night long. The second one was ALSO outside, he got stuck on a tree for four days. Finally, he came back home one day with his tail bleeding and ripped out. </p>
